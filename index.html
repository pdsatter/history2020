    <h2>Wealth Disparity:</h2>
    
    <p> 
        One major struggle America faces is the wealth gap between black and white households.
        The wealth gap was created after the abolition of slavery and continued to grow up until today.
        The reason for this continual growth is because after abolition African Americans were left stranded with little education and no experience living by themselves.
        This caused African American's to struggle right out of the gates.  Their lack of education along with the systemic racism they faced made African American's the lower caste in America. 
        They paid higher rents and recieve lower wages, which caused them to struggle to pay their bills.
        With just enough money to survive, often times black parents couldn't afford to send their kids to college and had little wealth left to pass 
        down to the next generation.  This lack of wealth occured generation after generation and continued to snowball.  The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
        In the book “<i>The Warmth of Other Suns</i>” Wilkerson shows that in Mississippi “White teachers and principals were making $630 a year, while the colored ones were paid a third of that - $215 a year” (Wilkerson 85).
        This problem existed over 70 years ago, however it still remains an issue today. <br></br>

    "In 1968, a typical middle-class black household had <span class = num1>$6,674</span> in wealth 
    compared with <span class = num1>$70,786</span> for the typical middle-class
     white household, according to data from the historical Survey of Consumer Finances that has been adjusted for inflation. 
     In 2016, the typical middle-class black household had <span class = num1>$13,024</span> in wealth versus <span class = num1>$149,703</span> for the median white household, 
     an even larger gap in percentage terms." 
    (Long and Dam).
    </p>
    <p>
    <br>
    <br>
    This graph goes to show that the wealth gap between each race has actually increased in the past 40 years.  In 1968 the
    wealth gap ratio was 1 : 10.61 in terms of black to white wealth.  
    That means for every 1 dollar a middle class black household had, a middle class white household had about $10.61 of wealth.  This ratio comes from 
    a middle class black household having about <span class = num1>$6,674</span>  as compared to an average middle class white household with <span class = num1>$70,786</span>.
    However this ratio increased in 2016 where an average middle class white household had <span class = num1>$149,704</span> in wealth compared to a black household with
    <span class = num1>$13,024</span>.  This is a wealth depararity of 1 : 11.49  for black households to white.  Despite 48 years of social progression happening,
    the wealth gap didn't decrease at all.  Accounting for inflation it still increased.
    <br>
    <br>
    How can we interpret this increasing wealth gap?  Analyzing this graph, the most noticeable reason for the increasing gap is the growth in wealth between races.  
    What do I mean by that?  African American households wealth has minimally grown.  
    Their wealth had an average increase of about $132.29 per year between 1968 and 2016.
    However if you look at the white households they have a much higher increase in wealth.  On average a white household
    increases their wealth by $1,644.10 a year between the years 1968 and 2016.  This is over ten times the amount of black households.
    Furthermore after the average wealth increased for the black population, it dropped back down during economic crisis.  During the 
    housing crisis African Americans took a large hit to their wealth, and have been recovering over the past decade.  Now the Corona virus
    hits and black households are hit harder than anyone else, due to their economically weak state.  
    Studies show that "more than 2 out of 5 black small businesses and self-employed workers have been forced to shutter during the pandemic" (Long and Dam).
    This focuses on the past 50 years in general, next the scope will narrow down to more recent years.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    African Americans average increase of wealth (adjusted for inflation): $132.29 a year.  
    <br>
    White average increase of wealth (adujusted for inflation): $1644.10 a year

        Note: The Washington Post's numbers are all lower than the federal reserve numbers shown here even though that was their source.
        This is because they accounted for inflation.  So they are putting it in equal buying power as 1968, so the numbers are lower.

        "Growth rates for the 2013-16 period were proportionally larger for Hispanic, other, and black families,
        rising between 30 and 50 percent, compared with white families, whose net worth rose 17 percent.
        Even with the large percentage gains for black and Hispanic families, the white-black gap in median net worth 
        increased from $132,800 in 2013 to $153,500 in 2016, and the white-Hispanic gap increased from $132,200
        in 2013 to $150,300 in 2016."

    <p>
        The increasing wealth gap from 2013 - 2016 can be attributed a number of things.  One is that during the great recession the wealth gap fell 30$ on average
        between everyone.  However African American's had an additonal 20% drop after that.  This means that they were hit harder in the 
        recession than white families.  Furthermore black households had a wealth growth of 30% and white households
        had a 17% wealth growth.  While this may seem substantial this would still mean the wealth gap is increasing 
        since the medium white household hold makes about 10 times what the mediun black household makes.

        So the increase of wealth between 2013 - 2016 would be about <span class = num1>$24,846.15</span> for white house holds and <span class = num1> 
        $4,061.54</span> for black house holds making the wealth gap increase by about $20,784.61.  *My caculations on these numbers are shown at end. <br>
        <br>How can we interpret this data?  One thing is for sure and that is that the wealth gap isn't going anywhere.  It is actually
        only growing.  The wealth gap in the 50's was obvious based on the more obvious signs of oppression such as segregation, unequal pay
        across the board, and even public lynchings.  Now adays this monster is more hidden, as the signs aren't as obvious today as 70 years ago.
        However the wealth gap isn't something that is easily solved.  With parents not being able to pass as much wealth onto their children, then
        this limits the growth of the children too.  This repeated through multiple generations creates an exponential gap between classes.  Were 
        the poor have to struggle to put food on the table while the rich enjoy a stable life and can create more wealth.  This is shown
        on the <a href = "https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/recent-trends-in-wealth-holding-by-race-and-ethnicity-evidence-from-the-survey-of-consumer-finances-20170927.htm" target = "_blank">

        <br>White families have higher assets in every category including: residence, vehicles, and businesses.
        This is also paired with higher credit card debt and education debt.  Where white families have higher housing debt.  Credit card is just bad debt,
        and is very destructive, especially to poor families.  Education debt isn't bad debt, however it does not have a direct value associated with it.
        You can't sell education back, however you can make more money by getting better paying jobs.  So since black families have higher
        education debt, they should have higher college graduation rates right?  We will see if this is true in a minute.  Regressing back to my
        debt arguement the higher white residence debt can be attributed to the higher values of their homes.  Where their homes are worth about 
        2.27 times more than black families (215.8 / 94.4).  The discrepency between debt and assets between the races attribute to
        "Nearly one in five black households has zero or negative net worth.
         The share of white households without any wealth is considerably smaller, at 9 percent." (Dettling, Hsu, Jacobs, Moore, Thompson, and Llanes, "Recent Trends in Wealth-Holding by Race and Ethnicity: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances")

        Calculations on wealth gap increase of medium African American households wealth and mediun white households wealth:
        Growth (increase of wealth) = new - old <br>
        White Household growth: <span class = cyan>171,000</span> - <span class = pink>146,153.85</span> = <span class = num1>24,846.15 </span> <br>

        <br>
        Calculating Old (median wealth in 2013): <br>
        Old = New / (1 + (100 * growthPercent)) <br>
        White household: Old = <span class = cyan>171,000</span> / (1.17) = <span class = pink>146,153.85</span> <br>
