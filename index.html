    <h2>Wealth Disparity:</h2>
    
    <p> 
        One major struggle America faces is the wealth gap between black and white households.
        The wealth gap was created after the abolition of slavery and continued to grow up until today.
        The reason for this continual growth is because after abolition African Americans were left stranded with little education and no experience living by themselves.
        This caused African American's to struggle right out of the gates.  Their lack of education along with the systemic racism they faced made African American's the lower caste in America. 
        They paid higher rents and recieve lower wages, which caused them to struggle to pay their bills.
        With just enough money to survive, often times black parents couldn't afford to send their kids to college and had little wealth left to pass 
        down to the next generation.  This lack of wealth occured generation after generation and continued to snowball.  The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
        In the book “<i>The Warmth of Other Suns</i>” Wilkerson shows that in Mississippi “White teachers and principals were making $630 a year, while the colored ones were paid a third of that - $215 a year” (Wilkerson 85).
        This problem existed over 70 years ago, however it still remains an issue today. <br>

    "In 1968, a typical middle-class black household had <span class = num1>$6,674</span> in wealth 
    compared with <span class = num1>$70,786</span> for the typical middle-class
     white household, according to data from the historical Survey of Consumer Finances that has been adjusted for inflation. 
     In 2016, the typical middle-class black household had <span class = num1>$13,024</span> in wealth versus <span class = num1>$149,703</span> for the median white household, 
     an even larger gap in percentage terms." 
    (Long and Dam).
    </p>
    <p>
    <br>
    <br>
    This graph and data show that the wealth gap between blacks and whites increased in the past 40 years.  In 1968 the
    wealth gap ratio was 1 : 10.61 in terms of black to white wealth.  
    That means for every 1 dollar a middle class black household had, a middle class white household had about $10.61 of wealth.  
    Or that it takes the wealth of 10.61 black families to equal the wealth of one white family.  This ratio comes from 
    a middle class black household having about <span class = num1>$6,674</span>  as compared to an average middle class white household with <span class = num1>$70,786</span>.
    However this ratio increased in 2016 where an average middle class white household had <span class = num1>$149,704</span> in wealth compared to a black household with
    <span class = num1>$13,024</span>.  This is a wealth depararity of 1 : 11.49 for black households to white (this number can vary based on if you're using mean/median and including inflation, however it is normally 1:10 or greater no matter which variable is used).  Despite 48 years of social progress,
    the wealth gap didn't decrease at all.  One that is noted for this is the white household with a high school diploma has more wealth than a
    black household with a bachelors (measured by median).

    How can we interpret this increasing wealth gap?  Analyzing this graph, the most noticeable reason for the increasing gap is the growth in wealth between races.  
    What do I mean by that?  African American households wealth has minimally grown.  
    Their wealth had an average increase of about $132.29 per year between 1968 and 2016.
    However if you look at the white households they have a much higher increase in wealth.  On average a white household
    increases their wealth by $1,644.10 a year between the years 1968 and 2016.  This is over ten times the amount of black households.
    Furthermore every economic crisis African Americans are hit the hardest.  Beating  back down any gain they had started to have.  
    For example during the housing crisis African Americans took a large hit to their wealth, and have been recovering over the past decade.  Now the Corona virus
    hits and black households are hit harder than anyone else, due to their economically weak state.  
    Studies show that "more than 2 out of 5 black small businesses and self-employed workers have been forced to shutter during the pandemic— well over twice the rate of white businesses" (Long and Dam).
    Just the fact that 40% of black small businesses and self employed people have taken this hit is crazy and goes to show how bad the pandemic
    is for African Americans especially.  Many of these businesses will not be able to recover, and will just reset all these people back to nothing all over again.

        Note: The Washington Post's numbers are all lower than the federal reserve numbers shown here even though that was their source.
        This is because they accounted for inflation.  So they are putting it in equal buying power as 1968, so the numbers are lower.

        "Growth rates for the 2013-16 period were proportionally larger for Hispanic, other, and black families,
        rising between 30 and 50 percent, compared with white families, whose net worth rose 17 percent.
        Even with the large percentage gains for black and Hispanic families, the white-black gap in median net worth 
        increased from $132,800 in 2013 to $153,500 in 2016, and the white-Hispanic gap increased from $132,200
        in 2013 to $150,300 in 2016." 
        (Dettling, Hsu, Jacobs, Moore, Thompson, and Llanes, "Recent Trends in Wealth-Holding by Race and Ethnicity: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances")
    </p>

    <p>
        The increasing wealth gap from 2013 - 2016 can be attributed a number of things.  The median wealth fell for every race, however 
        African American households fell 20% more when compared to white households.  
        This is a devistating drop because on average black families have a tenth of the wealth of the average white family.  
        Furthermore, black households had a wealth growth of 30% and white households
        had a 17% wealth growth.  While this may sound good at first, this would still mean the wealth gap is actually increasing. 
        This is because 17% of 171,000 is way higher than 30% of 17,600.  White households get richer and richer, which just snowballs from generation to generation.
        While many black households struggle to pay their bills, college loans, or to feed their families.  So minimal wealth can be accumulated.

        The increase of wealth between 2013 - 2016 would be about <span class = num1>$24,846.15</span> for white house holds and <span class = num1> 
        $4,061.54</span> for black house holds making the wealth gap increase by about $20,784.61.  *My caculations on these numbers are shown at end. <br>
        <br>How can we interpret this data?  One thing is for sure and that is that the wealth gap isn't going anywhere.  It is actually
        only growing.  The wealth gap in the 50's was obvious based on the more obvious signs of oppression such as segregation, unequal pay
        across the board, and even public lynchings.  Nowadays this monster is more hidden, as the signs aren't as obvious today as 70 years ago.
        However the wealth gap isn't something that is easily solved.  Parents aren't able to pass wealth onto their children, which makes it harder to have a better life than their parents.  
        Repeating this through multiple generations creates an exponential gap between classes.  Were 
        the poor have to struggle to put food on the table while the rich enjoy a stable life and can create more wealth.
        <br>
        <br>White families have higher assets in every category including: residence, vehicles, and businesses,
        while having lower credit card and education debt.  White families on average have higher housing debt, but this is mainly because the housing value is higher.
        Where white homes on average are worth about 2.29 times more than black families (215.8 / 94.4).
        The main difference between something like housing debt and credit card debt is that housing debt is considered good debt, but credit card debt is bad debt.
        Credit card debt easily snowballs and will tear poor families apart, and they have no assets left to show for this debt.
        Education debt isn't bad debt, however there is a flaw with it.
        Education isn't tangible so you can't sell it like other assets. The benefit is having better paying jobs after college.
        <br><br>
        The main problem is that while black student leave college with more debt, on average they make less money than white students 
        after graduating.  The median net worth of people with bachelors degree in 2016 was a 5.82 : 1 ratio of white to black average wealth (397.1 : 68.2). 
        The discrepency between debt and assets between the races attribute to
        "Nearly one in five black households has zero or negative net worth.
        The share of white households without any wealth is considerably smaller, at 9 percent." (Dettling, Hsu, Jacobs, Moore, Thompson, and Llanes)
