    <h2>Wealth Disparity:</h2>
    
    <p> 
        One major struggle America faces is the wealth gap between black and white households.
        The wealth gap was created since the abolition of slavery and continues to grow today.
        The reason for this continual growth is because after abolition African Americans were left stranded with little education and no experience living by themselves.
        This caused African American's to struggle right out of the gate.  Their lack of education along with the systemic racism they faced made African American's the lower caste in American society. 
        They paid higher rents and recieved lower wages, which caused them to struggle to pay their bills.
        With just enough money to survive, often times black parents couldn't afford to send their kids to college and had little wealth left to pass 
        down to the next generation.  This lack of wealth occured generation after generation and continued to snowball.  The rich continue to get richer and the poor continue to get poorer.
        In the book “<i>The Warmth of Other Suns</i>” Wilkerson shows that in Mississippi 
        “White teachers and principals were making $630 a year, while the colored ones were paid a third of that - $215 a year” <sup>1</sup>.
        This problem existed over 70 years ago, however it still remains an issue today. <br>

    "In 1968, a typical middle-class black household had <span class = num1>$6,674</span> in wealth 
    compared with <span class = num1>$70,786</span> for the typical middle-class
     white household, according to data from the historical Survey of Consumer Finances that has been adjusted for inflation. 
     In 2016, the typical middle-class black household had <span class = num1>$13,024</span> in wealth versus <span class = num1>$149,703</span> for the median white household, 
     an even larger gap in percentage terms." <sup>2</sup>
    <br>

    </p>
    <p>
    <br>
    <br>
    The graph and data show that the wealth gap between blacks and whites has increased in the past 40 years.  In 1968 the
    black to white wealth gap ratio was 1 : 10.61.  
    That means for every $1 a middle class black household had in wealth, a middle class white household had about $10.61 of wealth.  
    Or that it takes the wealth of 10.61 black families to equal the wealth of one white family.  This ratio comes from 
    a middle class black household having about <span class = num1>$6,674</span>  as compared to an average middle class white household with <span class = num1>$70,786</span>.
    However this ratio increased in 2016 where an average middle class white household had <span class = num1>$149,704</span> in wealth compared to a black household with
    <span class = num1>$13,024</span>.  This is a wealth depararity of 1 : 11.49 for black households to white.  Despite 48 years of social progress,
    the wealth gap didn't decrease at all. (average is measured by the median wealth, however data based off of the mean also has a ratio greater than 1:5 today).

    How can we interpret this increasing wealth gap?  Analyzing this graph, the most noticeable reason for the increasing gap is the growth in wealth between races.  
    What do I mean by that?  African American households wealth has minimally grown.  
    Black household's wealth increased by $132.29 per year (on average) between 1968 and 2016,
    while white household's wealth increased by $1,644.10 a year (on average) between the years 1968 and 2016. 
    Furthermore economic crises hit African Americans the hardest.  Any economic gain they begin to obtain is destroyed during economic turmoil.  
    When the housing crisis hit African Americans took a large hit, and have been trying to recover over the past decade.  However before a full recovery the Corona virus
    hits and black households are destroyed, due to their already economically weak state.  
    Studies show that "more than 2 out of 5 black small businesses and self-employed workers have been forced to shutter during the pandemic— well over twice the rate of white businesses" <sup>3</sup>.
    40% of black small businesses and self employed people are heavily hit shows how badly the pandemic
    effects African Americans especially.  Many of these businesses will not be able to recover, and will just reset all these people back to nothing all over again.

        "Growth rates for the 2013-16 period were proportionally larger for Hispanic, other, and black families,
        rising between 30 and 50 percent, compared with white families, whose net worth rose 17 percent.
        Even with the large percentage gains for black and Hispanic families, the white-black gap in median net worth 
        increased from $132,800 in 2013 to $153,500 in 2016, and the white-Hispanic gap increased from $132,200
        in 2013 to $150,300 in 2016" <sup>4</sup>.
        
    </p>

    <p>
        The increasing wealth gap from 2013 - 2016 can be attributed a number of things.    
        Between 2013-2016 black households had a growth in wealth of 30%, while white households
        only had a 17% growth.  While this may sound good at first, but this would mean the wealth gap is actually increasing. 
        This is because 17% of 171,000 is way higher than 30% of 17,600.  White households get richer each passing generation, while black households stay stuck.
        Many black households still struggle to pay their bills, college loans, or to feed their families,which leaves little room for wealth accumulation to pass on to the next generation.

        The increase of wealth between 2013 - 2016 would be about <span class = num1>$24,846.15</span> for white house holds and <span class = num1> 
        $4,061.54</span> for black house holds making the wealth gap increase by about $20,784.61.  *My calculations on these numbers are shown at end. <br>
        <br>
        How can we interpret this data?  One thing is for sure and that is that the wealth gap isn't going anywhere.  It is actually
        only growing.  The wealth gap in the 50's was obvious based on the more obvious signs of oppression such as segregation, unequal pay,
        and public lynchings.  Nowadays this monster is more hidden, as the signs aren't as obvious today as 70 years ago.
        However the wealth gap isn't something that is easily solved.  Black parents aren't able to pass wealth onto their children, which makes it harder for kids to have a better life than their parents.  
        Repeating this through multiple generations creates an increasing gap between classes.  The poor struggle to put food on the table, and the rich enjoy a stable life and can create more wealth with each generation.
        <br>
        <br>
        White families have higher assets in every category including: residence, vehicles, and businesses,
        while having lower credit card and education debt.  White families actually have a higher average housing debt, but this can be attributed to the larger value of the houses bought.
        White homes, on average, are worth about 2.29 times more than black homes (mean net housing worth is 215.8k for whites, and 94.4k for blacks).
        Black families have larger credit card and education debt compared to white families. 
        The main difference between something like housing debt and credit card debt is that housing debt is good debt and credit card debt is bad debt.
        Credit card debt easily snowballs and will tear poor families apart. After paying off this high interest debt, there are no real assets of value obtained from all this debt.
        Education debt may not be considered bad debt, but it's not without flaws.
        Education isn't tangible and can't be sold off like other assets. The benefit comes with higher paying jobs that will pay more than the debt taken.
        <br>
        <br>
        A problem is created because while black students leave college with more debt, they go on to make less money than white students after college.  
        The median net worth of people with bachelors degree in 2016 was a 5.82 : 1 ratio of white to black average wealth (397.1 : 68.2). 
        Overall black households have less net worth than white households where
        "Nearly one in five black households has zero or negative net worth.
        The share of white households without any wealth is considerably smaller, at 9 percent." <sup>5</sup>
